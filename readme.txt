Battleship: Luck Mode

Description

Battleship: Luck Mode is a twist on the classic Battleship game, where players must find and hit 8 ships while avoiding hidden bombs scattered across the board. Unlike traditional Battleship, there are no enemy ships firing back—your biggest challenge is testing your luck and making the right choices!


How to Play

    The game board consists of a grid where ships and bombs are randomly placed.
    The player selects coordinates to fire at, revealing what’s hidden in that location.
    If a ship is hit, the player progresses toward victory.
    If a bomb is hit, the player moves closer to losing the game.
    The game ends when the player either finds 8 ships (win) or hits 3 bombs (lose).


Features

    Randomized ship and bomb placement for a unique experience every game.
    Simple but strategic gameplay that combines skill and luck.
    A challenging balance between risk and reward.


Winning & Losing Conditions

    Win: Successfully find and hit 8 ships before hitting 3 bombs.
    Lose: Hit 3 bombs, causing an instant defeat.
